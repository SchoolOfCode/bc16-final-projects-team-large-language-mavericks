# Internship Curriculum Breakdown

At School of Code, Bootcampers will **experience working in almost every area of a technology company** to give them a good all-round grounding, and learn what their strengths, weaknesses, and passions are. We have structured this through a series of internship modules. In these internships, our aim to set them up for success in that direction, their aim is to do exactly what you'd do in any job - **learn as much as possible**, **build relationships with your team mates**, and **deliver value**.
